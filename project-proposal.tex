% Project Background
%=====================================================================================%
\begin{section}[assets/images/blood.png]{Background}
 In 2022, our students developed a novel digital lock box, named
 \textbf{BLOOD (Bichannel Lockbox On One Device)}. This system is planned to be the
 successor to the \textbf{EVIL} lock box, which has been in use for a
 decade. BLOOD, featuring a Red Pitaya FPGA board and a custom-designed PCB,
 maintains backward compatibility with existing EVIL setups and our DEVIL client/server
 software. A major improvement in BLOOD compared to its predecessor is the
 capability to digitally control analog gain and offset parameters. The first prototype
 of BLOOD has shown promising results, successfully stabilizing laser frequencies in
 the lab. Nonetheless, further development is necessary to fully unlock its potential.

% Proposal
%=====================================================================================%
\begin{section}{Proposal}
 We propose one or two semester projects focused on improving and extending the
 capabilities of the BLOOD device. The main goals and expected outcomes are:

 \begin{itemize}
     \item {Continued development of BLOOD to ensure its readiness for regular lab use.}
     \item {Adding support for the second channel of the device.}
     \item {Resolving existing issues to improve reliability and optimize performance.}
 \end{itemize}

 Achieving these objectives will contribute significantly to our group's research and
 give you a great learning experience.
